# Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML
Here I have created the prediction model using the Unsupervised ML and I have predicted the model using the K means Clustering

ALGORITHM USED - K-Means
K-means is a centroid-based algorithm, or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-Means, each cluster is associated with a centroid.

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

● Used Python to perform this task
